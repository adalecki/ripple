#x Change "Submit" on calculator to clear previous plates, then resubmit using new form values, instead of requiring user to manually clear plates.
#x "Total compounds" number on the checkpoint modal shouldn't report solvents as a compound
#x Updated src vols sheet needs to pull name dynamically; apparently hardcoded to "testEcho?"
#x Add tooltip to DMSO and allowable error saying they're fractions not percentages
#x Generated templates from design tab don't have Assay sheet
#x Change control names; "MaxCtrl" still ambiguous. Move to "MaxReadout" or something. - Added tooltip
#x Well tooltip should transform toward the center of the plate based on quadrant; it'll slam up against the side, compressing the information within.
#x In Data Parser, selecting a protocol, uploading a file, removing file, and changing protocol prevents uploading to new protocol?
#x Need to find a better way to do DMSO solvent. Right now the Excel sheet doesn't automatically come with a DMSO pattern. Why bother putting it in at all? Shouldn't the validation step just insert the pattern for you?
#x Filename parsing in Protocol Manager isn't intuitive. At minimum add a tooltip to explain it.
#x Add "clear plates" button to other tabs in mapperparser
#x Find better workflow for saving protocols. Right now users make an edit, then navigate away. Maybe an alert when tab changes if it's editing?
# When changing plate size in Protocol Manager, if going to a smaller size and controls are outside the limit, get an error
#x Trim pattern and cpd names from input sheet for trailing white spaces
# Uploading data files under wrong protocol just silently fails
#x Remove TransferStep from EchoCalculatorClass, consolidate to TransferStepExport in plateUtils
# Hide "Backfill" field when "use intermediate plates" is not selected
# Change default preference to *not* split CSVs and zip
#x In TransferList, the delete button is pushed to the side if the transfer block is too long
#x Add ability to edit transfer volumes
# Add default plate reformat transfers - compress, decompress, interleave
#x "Treat as identical" option for any number of src wells to any number of dst wells
